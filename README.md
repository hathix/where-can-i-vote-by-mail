A super simple repository that tracks where Americans can (and can't)
vote by mail in the November 2020 general election.

The good news is that no swing states (except Texas) forbid vote-by-mail.
The bad news is that many states have no experience running elections with
so much mail-in voting, so they may have trouble counting votes on Election
Night.

please feel free to make a pull request.

If someone would like to turn the above map into a table, and perhaps cross-reference
with voting history and number of electoral votes, please help with that!
We hope this can become a useful resource for American voters.
